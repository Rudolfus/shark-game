# Introduction

Bondi Bite is my first game for web browsers. It is a visually attractive, nostalgic-looking game with basic functions. The project is not considered fully done. Instead, it represents a beta version that could and should be improved for an even more enjoyable experience.

# Documentation

Not available for Bondi Bite.

# Setup

You need a functioning browser (that you are using right now) and for the best possible experience, a 16:9 screen (so far, a 4:3 ratio will distort the game).
